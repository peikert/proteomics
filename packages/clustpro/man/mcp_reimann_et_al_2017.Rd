\description{
Project description: The Z-disc is a protein-rich structure critically important for myofibril development and integrity.
In order to monitor the quantiative changes in C2C12 myoblast during myogenesis, a quantitative dimethyl-labelling approach was performed with d0 myoblasts, d5 myotubes and electrical puls stimulated d5 myotubes.
Data: Excerpts from the MaxQuant output files "proteinGroups.txt" (spreadsheet proteins); details for protein/protein group identification are given.
Identifications referring to reverse hits and potential contaminants have been removed.
